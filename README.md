# `Polars` Documentation

This repo contains the [User Guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/) for the [`Polars` DataFrame library](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars).

## Getting Started

To build the benchmarks and `Python` code examples, `Graphviz`, `make`, `wget` as well as the `Python` packages listed in `requirements.txt` need to be present on the system.

To build the User Guide, the `Rust`-based [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) executable should also be downloaded/compiled and accessible (in the `PATH`).

To build the Reference Guide, a custom `mdBook` executable should also be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ritchie46/mdBook/releases/download/api-0.0.1/mdbook) and made accessible as `mdbook2` in the `PATH`.

### Using the *Makefile*

The reference guide requires a specific Python version to be used. Make sure to check `__main__.SRC` for reference guide work.

Use `make serve` to serve the user guide.

## Reference Guides

At this point in time, only `Python` and `NodeJS` bindings are available for `Polars`.

The content of the Reference Guides is generated directly from the source code.
In this repo one can find the scripts used to generate the `Markdown` content later rendered by `mdBook` (a custom version thereof).
