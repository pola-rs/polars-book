# Introduction

This book is an introduction to the
[`Polars` DataFrame library](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). Its goal is to
introduce you to `Polars` by going through examples and comparing it to other
solutions. Some design choices are introduced here. The guide will also introduce you to
optimal usage of `Polars`.

Even though `Polars` is completely written in [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (no
runtime overhead!) and uses [`Arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/) -- the
[native arrow2 `Rust` implementation](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2) -- as its foundation, the
examples presented in this guide will be mostly using its higher-level language
bindings. Higher-level bindings only serve as a thin wrapper for functionality implemented in the core library.

For [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) users, our
[Python package](https://pypi.org/project/polars/) will offer the easiest way to get started with
`Polars`.

## Goals and non-goals

The goal of `Polars` is to provide a lightning fast `DataFrame` library that utilizes all
available cores on your machine. Unlike tools such as dask -- which tries to parallelize existing single-threaded libraries
like `NumPy` and `Pandas` -- `Polars` is written from the ground up, designed for parallelization of queries on `DataFrame`s.

`Polars` goes to great lengths to:

- Reduce redundant copies
- Traverse memory cache efficiently
- Minimize contention in parallelism

`Polars` is lazy and semi-lazy. It allows you to do most of your work eagerly, similar to `Pandas`, but
it also provides a powerful expression syntax that will be optimized and executed on within the query engine.

In lazy `Polars` we are able to do query optimization on the entire query, further improving performance and memory pressure.

`Polars` keeps track of your query in a *logical plan*. This
plan is optimized and reordered before running it. When a result is requested, `Polars`
distributes the available work to different *executors* that use the algorithms available
in the eager API to produce a result. Because the whole query context is known to
the optimizer and executors of the logical plan, processes dependent on separate data
sources can be parallelized on the fly.

### Performance ðŸš€ðŸš€

`Polars` is very fast, and in fact is one of the best performing solutions available.
See the results in h2oai's db-benchmark. The image below shows the biggest datasets yielding a result.

`Polars` [TPCH Benchmark results](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) are now available on the official website.

### Current status

Below a concise list of the features allowing `Polars` to meet its goals:

- [Copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) (COW) semantics
  - "Free" clones
  - Cheap appends
- Appending without clones
- Column oriented data storage
  - No block manager (i.e. predictable performance)
- Missing values indicated with bitmask
  - NaN are different from missing
  - Bitmask optimizations
- Efficient algorithms
- Very fast IO
  - Its csv and parquet readers are among the fastest in existence
- [Query optimizations](optimizations/lazy/intro.md)
  - Predicate pushdown
    - Filtering at scan level
  - Projection pushdown
    - Projection at scan level
  - Aggregate pushdown
    - Aggregations at scan level
  - Simplify expressions
  - Parallel execution of physical plan
  - Cardinality based groupby dispatch
    - Different groupby strategies based on data cardinality
- SIMD vectorization
- [`NumPy` universal functions](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html)
