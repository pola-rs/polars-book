# GroupBy

## A multithreaded approach

One of the most efficient ways to process tabular data is to parallelize its processing
via the "split-apply-combine" approach. This operation is at the core of the `Polars`
grouping implementation, allowing it to attain lightning-fast operations. Specifically, both the "split" and "apply" phases are executed in a multi-threaded
fashion.

A simple grouping operation is taken below as an example to illustrate this approach:

For the hashing operations performed during the "split" phase, `Polars` uses a
multithreaded lock-free approach that is illustrated on the following schema:

This parallelization allows the grouping and joining operations (for instance) to be
blazingly fast!

## Do not kill the parallelization!

> The following is specific to `Python`, and doesn't apply to `Rust`.  Within `Rust`, blocks and closures (_lambdas_) can, and will, be executed concurrently.

We have all heard that `Python` is slow, and does "not scale." Besides the overhead of
running "slow" bytecode, `Python` has to remain within the constraints of the Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL). This means that if you were to use a `lambda` or a custom `Python`
function to apply during a parallelized phase, `Polars` speed is capped running `Python`
code preventing any multiple threads from executing the function.

This all feels terribly limiting, especially because we often need those `lambda` functions in a
`.groupby()` step, for example. This approach is still supported by `Polars`, but
keeping in mind bytecode **and** the GIL costs have to be paid.

To mitigate this, `Polars` implements a powerful syntax defined not only in its lazy API,
but also in its eager API.  Let's take a look at what that means.

We can start with the simple
[US congress `dataset`](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators).

> Note to Rust users, the `dtype-categorical` feature must be enabled for the examples in this section.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/dataset.py:5:}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:dataset}}
```

</div>

#### Basic aggregations

You can easily combine different aggregations by adding multiple expressions in a
`list`. There is no upper bound on the number of aggregations you can do, and you can
make any combination you want. In the snippet below we do the following aggregations:

Per GROUP `"first_name"` we

- count the number of rows in the group:
  - short form: `pl.count("party")`
  - full form: `pl.col("party").count()`
- aggregate the gender values groups:
  - full form: `pl.col("gender")`
- get the first value of column `"last_name"` in the group:
  - short form: `pl.first("last_name")` (not available in Rust)
  - full form: `pl.col("last_name").first()`

Besides the aggregation, we immediately sort the result and limit to the top `5` so that
we have a nice summary overview.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet1.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:aggregation}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output1.txt}}
```

#### Conditionals

It's that easy! Let's turn it up a notch. Let's say we want to know how
many delegates of a "state" are "Pro" or "Anti" administration. We could directly query
that in the aggregation without the need of `lambda` or grooming the `DataFrame`.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet2.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:condtional}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output2.txt}}
```

Similarly,  this could also be done with a nested GROUPBY, but that doesn't help show off some of these nice features. ðŸ˜‰

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet3.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:nested_groupby}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output3.txt}}
```

#### Filtering

We can also filter the groups. Let's say we want to compute a mean per group, but we
don't want to include all values from that group, and we also don't want to filter the
rows from the `DataFrame` (because we need those rows for another aggregation).

In the example below we show how that can be done.

> Note that we can make `Python` functions for clarity. These functions don't cost us anything. That is because we only create `Polars` expressions, we don't apply a custom function over a `Series` during runtime of the query.  Of course, you can make functions that return expressions in Rust, too.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet4.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:filtering}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output4.txt}}
```

#### Sorting

It's common to see a `DataFrame` being sorted for the sole purpose of managing the ordering during a GROUPBY operation. Let's say that we want to get the names of the oldest and youngest politicians per state. We could SORT and GROUPBY.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet5.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:sorting1}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output5.txt}}
```

However, **if** we also want to sort the names alphabetically, this breaks. Luckily we can sort in a `groupby` context separate from the `DataFrame`.

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet6.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:sorting2}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output6.txt}}
```

We can even sort by another column in the `groupby` context. If we want to know if the alphabetically sorted name is male or female we could add: `pl.col("gender").sort_by("first_name").first().alias("gender")`

<div class="tabbed-blocks">

```python
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/snippet7.py}}
```

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/groupby_dsl/groupby.rs:sorting3}}
```

</div>

```text
{{#include ../outputs/groupby_dsl/output7.txt}}
```

### Conclusion

In the examples above we've seen that we can do a lot by combining expressions. By doing so we delay the use of custom `Python` functions that slow down the queries (by the slow nature of Python AND the GIL).
