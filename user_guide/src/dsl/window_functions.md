# Window functions ðŸš€ðŸš€

Window functions are expressions with superpowers. They allow you to do aggregation on groups in the
**select** context. Let's get a feel of what that means. First we create a dataset. The dataset loaded in the
snippet below contains information about pokemon and has the following columns:

`['#',  'Name',  'Type 1',  'Type 2',  'Total',  'HP',  'Attack',  'Defense',  'Sp. Atk',  'Sp. Def',  'Speed',  'Generation',  'Legendary']`

```python
{{#include ../examples/expressions/window_1.py:0:}}
```

```text
{{#include ../outputs/expressions/window_1.txt}}
```

## Groupby Aggregations in selection

Below we show how we use window function to group over different columns and do an aggregation on them.
Doing so, allows us to do multiple groupby operations in parallel in a single query. The results of the aggregation
are projected back to the original rows. A window function will therefore always lead to a DataFrame with the same size
as the original.

Note how we call over on `.over("Type 1")` and on `.over(["Type 1", "Type 2"])`. Using window functions we can aggregate
over different groups in a single `select` call!

The best thing is, this won't cost you anything. The computed groups are cached and shared between different `window` expressions.

```python
{{#include ../examples/expressions/window_2.py:3:}}
```

```text
{{#include ../outputs/expressions/window_2.txt}}
```

## Operations per group

Window functions can do more that aggregation. They can also be seen as an operation with a groups. If you for instance
want to `sort` the values within a `group`, you can write `col("value").sort().over("group")` and voila, sorted by group.

Let's see filter out some rows to make this more clear.

```python
{{#include ../examples/expressions/window_group_1.py:4:}}
print(filtered)
```

```text
{{#include ../outputs/expressions/window_group_1.txt}}
```

Observe that the group `Water` of column `Type 1` is not contiguous. There are two rows of `Grass` in between. Als no
that the pokemon within a group are ordered by `Speed` in `ascending` order. I don't like that. I want them ordered in
`descending` speed order. Luckily with window functions, this is a breeze.

```python
{{#include ../examples/expressions/window_group_2.py:4:}}
print(out)
```

```text

{{#include ../outputs/expressions/window_group_2.txt}}
```

Polars keeps track of the groups locations and maps the expressions to the proper row locations. Also this could be done
over different groups in a single `select` it will work.

The power of window expressions is that you often don't need a `groupby -> explode` combination, but you can put the logic in a
single expressions. It also makes the API cleaner. If proper used a:

- `groupby` -> marks that groups are aggregated and we expect a `DataFrame` of size `n_groups`
- `.over()` -> marks that we want to compute something within a group, but that we don't modify the original size of the `DataFrame`

## Window expression rules

The evaluation of window expressions are as followed (assuming we apply on `pl.Int32` column):

```python
# aggregate and broadcast within a group
# output type: -> Int32
pl.sum("foo").over("groups")

# sum within a group and multiply with group elements
# output type: -> Int32
(pl.col("x").sum() * pl.col("y")).over("groups")

# sum within a group and multiply with group elements 
# and aggregate the group to a list
# output type: -> List(Int32)
(pl.col("x").sum() * pl.col("y")).list().over("groups")

# note that it will require an explicit `list()` call
# sum within a group and multiply with group elements 
# and aggregate the group to a list
# the flatten call explodes that list

# This is the fastest method to do things over groups when the groups are sorted
(pl.col("x").sum() * pl.col("y")).list().over("groups").flatten()
```

## More examples

Below we flex our muscles with window function to compute:

- sort all pokemon by type
- select the first 3 pokemon per type as `"Type 1"`
- sort the pokemon within a type by speed and select the first 3 as `"fastest/group"`
- sort the pokemon within a type by attack and select the first 3 as `"strongest/group"`
- sort the pokemon by name within a type and select the first 3 as `"sorted_by_alphabet"`

```python
{{#include ../examples/expressions/window_3.py:3:}}
```

{{#include ../outputs/expressions/window_3.txt}}
```

## Flattened window function

If we have a window function that aggregates to a `list` like we did above with the following expression:
`pl.col("Name").sort_by(pl.col("Speed")).head(3).list().over("Type 1")` we could just leave it like that, but that
would give us a column type `List` which is often not what we want (and it increases our memory usage a lot!).

Instead we could `flatten`. This just turns our 2D list into a 1D array and projects that array/column back to our DataFrame.
This is very fast, because the reshape is often free and adding the column back the the original DataFrame is also a lot cheaper,
because we don't require a join like in a normal window function.

For this operation to make sense however, it is important that the columns used in `over([..])` are sorted!
