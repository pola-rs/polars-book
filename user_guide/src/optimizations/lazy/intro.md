# Lazy API

> The Lazy API page is under construction.

To demonstrate the lazy `Polars` capabilities we'll explore two medium-large
datasets of usernames:

[Reddit usernames dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/9i8s5j/dataset_metadata_for_69_million_reddit_users_in/)
containing 69+ million rows

```python
{{#include ../../examples/head/snippet1.py}}
```

```text
{{#include ../../outputs/head/output1.txt}}
```

and the [Runescape username dataset](https://github.com/RuneStar/name-cleanup-2014)
containing about 55+ million records.

```python
{{#include ../../examples/head/snippet2.py}}
```

```text
{{#include ../../outputs/head/output2.txt}}
```
