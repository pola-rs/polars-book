# Process strings

Thanks to its `Arrow` backend, `Polars` string operations are much faster compared to the
same operations performed with `NumPy` or `Pandas`. In the latter, strings are stored as
`Python` objects. While traversing the `np.array` or the `pd.Series` the CPU needs to
follow all the string pointers, and jump to many random memory locations -- which
is very cache-inefficient. In `Polars` (via the `Arrow` data
structure) strings are contiguous in memory. Thus traversing is cache-optimal and
predictable for the CPU.

The string processing functions available in `Polars` are available in the
[`str` namespace](POLARS_PY_REF_GUIDE/series/strings.html).

Below are a few examples. To compute string lengths:

```python
{{#include ../../examples/strings/snippet1.py}}
```

returning:

```text
{{#include ../../outputs/strings/output1.txt}}
```

And below a regex pattern to filter out articles (`the`, `a`, `and`, *etc.*) from a
sentence:

```python
{{#include ../../examples/strings/snippet2.py}}
```

yielding:

```text
{{#include ../../outputs/strings/output2.txt}}
```
